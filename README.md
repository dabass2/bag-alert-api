# Major Bag Alert API

The `Major Bag Alert` API is a low overhead, cross platform, RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) built on the powerful [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) utilizing industry-defining Neural Network techniques.

`Major Bag Alert`, at its core, is an API that can be used to determine if any given moment in time is considered a "Major Bag Alert", as defined in the hit song [*Major Bag Alert*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAJ_n8iVn6E) by DJ Khaled featuring (the) Migos.

## Usage
Since the `Major Bag Alert` API is a RESTful API, it can be accessed with a simple `GET` request. An example would be

    axios.get("https://alert.leinad.pw")
      .then((res) => {
        console.log(res.data)
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error(err)
      })

Which could return

    {"active_alert": false}
